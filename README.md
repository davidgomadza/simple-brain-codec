Thoughts to Word or Audio 
How It Works:

1. Input: Enter a thought or brain signal (text).
2. Encode: Converts the text into a simulated electromagnetic signal (Base64 + reversed).
3. Decode: Reverses the encoding process to reveal the original thought.
4. CNB Integration: Simulates connection to the CNB Wearable Brain Reader System.
